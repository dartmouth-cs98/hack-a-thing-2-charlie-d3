1.Short description of what you attempted to build
* I tried to make a small data visualizer, which takes user data and displays it as a bar graph. I also tried to make the bar graph aesthetically pleasing with a smooth animation. I also spent several hours attempting to make a pie chart with the same data, but I couldn't get the labels to work or the data to dynamically update.
2. I worked alone 
3. What you learned
* I learned how to use the d3.js library, and practiced some of the general web development skills I learned last time
4. How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
* This will be useful for the data dashboard part of my project
5. What didn't work?
 * The pie chart. I just didn't add the labels and instead of animating the pie chart changes i just deleted the chart and replaced it with a new one
